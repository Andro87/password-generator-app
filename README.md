## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

This project straightened my knowledge of React and Javascript as it tested it through all the specific aspects I had to pay attention to.
While working on the project, the main difficulties I encountered
have regarded how to create a custom slider bar and checkboxes and generate a random password based on the user's selected inclusion options.
Aspects like password validation and how to establish its strength are open to improvements in the future.
It was a great challenge to work on as it allowed me to focus on different aspects and cases a user could face when interacting with this app.
